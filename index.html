    <p>School is hard, but it is OK because I will learn it. My favorite part has been the most challenging as well. Excel is something I enjoy even if it stresses me out. The more I fail, the more I learn.</p>

          <h4>Excel</h4>
          <h5>22&degC (72&degF)</h5>Having an easy tool for tracking numbers and such is actually really helpful.
          <p>I hope to be really good at Excel by the end of the semester.</p>

      <h2>Brazil</h2>
      <p>Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
        produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.</p>
